WP 4.3 B100 LTS (Long Term Stable)

This bundle set was developed in an attempt to ease the creation of a 
new WordPress site by the average user, do-it-yourselfer or developer.
This was done by carefully vetting a set of plugins considered essential
to round out the core WordPress package. These include plugins that add
backup, security, caching and optimization. In addition a plugin has 
been developed that allows for automated one click site configuration. 
This plugin is called WP Site DNA to represent the fact it encapsulates
the entire site configuration in a set of stand alone files.  These 
files then use functions included in the WordPress core to configure the site
in the way specified. This allows for fewer errors and missed settings
on install, and fewer keystrokes and clicks to establish the initial settings.

This method could be used to ascertain and capture the user configuration 
in advance of the site actually being built so that, once a site is 
actually installed, this pre-captured configuration can then be implemented
with a single click.  This method is also adaptaple, so that if the 
core configuration changes, the DNA (or RNA actually), can be modified
to follow suit.

The configuration (DNA) plugin separates out the data (the genome) from
the functions that implement the genome so that this configuration can be easily 
updated without affecting other parts of the "cell structure".  In addition,
(to make bioengineers a little jealous) this genome comes with a set of "dip switches"
so that each individual part (the C-T, G-A pairs) can be turned on or off individually,
without affecting other parts of the "genome". Now only if life were this simple!
